This is a chrome extension that blocks the most common intrusive websites to provide you the safe browser experience!

## features:
- block network requests to most common data fetching and ad showing websites. 
- user can whitelist and blacklist the websites to block
- user can block distracting social media sites and user won't be able to access them

## USP
- there are already many existing website/adblockers. But this is differnt from them in two ways
1. FOSS => unlike all other extensions, this is free and open source so we gurantee that the data is not taken by us as this is the main purpose of the extension.
2. Customizability => the user can add and remove the websites to block in this.
